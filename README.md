 
Comparing multiple machine learning NLP models on conduct risk related communications within a financial services domain.
Models vary from neural network nlp models to more traditional TF-IDF based models. Neural models vary through the notebook from models with 1d CNN's to LSTMS's and fully connected nets. In the real world models need to detect target content that might represent just a tiny fraction of the total electronic communications passing through a server any any given point in time. 

Not included in the notebook are tests using novelty detection algorithms. Here classes are deliberately balanced, F1 scores are compared and the goal is to find the most efficient, least complex and least computationally expensive model.
